# Aurora

Aurora aligns the theme: Empowering young professionals with AI: From Day One to Future Leaders.

Agents: Onboarding Buddy (FAQ + citations), Skill Navigator (generic plan incl. compliance/ethics/behaviour/role), Progress Companion (LMS progress + nudges).

Responsible AI: consent, citations, audit with HMAC, minimal PII, human-in-the-loop option.

Production-leaning stack: OpenAI API, MySQL, connection pooling, retries, env-first config, async audit, RAG on curated docs.

Frontend intentionally not connected yet; backend is stable and deployable.
